# Enhanced MISSNET Test Suite - Summary of Improvements

## Overview
The `test_missnet_synthetic.py` file has been significantly enhanced to address the multivariate advantage testing requirements you outlined. The enhanced suite now properly demonstrates when MISSNET should outperform per-column methods and provides comprehensive testing of the multivariate capabilities.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Strong Cross-Feature Correlation Tests**
- **Implementation**: Added `run_multivariate_advantage_tests()` method
- **What it does**: Creates data with strong cross-feature correlation (rho=0.8) before masking
- **Why it matters**: This is the key test you requested - MISSNET should show advantage when variables are correlated
- **Results**: Shows clear correlation analysis with mean/max off-diagonal correlation metrics

### 2. **MAR/MNAR Stress Tests**
- **Implementation**: Added `run_mar_mnar_stress_tests()` method
- **What it does**: Tests across different correlation strengths (0.3, 0.6, 0.9) with MAR and MNAR patterns
- **Why it matters**: Other variables help decide/impute missing values in these patterns
- **Results**: Demonstrates performance differences between missing patterns

### 3. **Block Missing Stress Tests**
- **Implementation**: Added `introduce_block_missing()` helper and `run_block_missing_stress_tests()` method
- **What it does**: Creates long gaps (block missing patterns) where per-column methods struggle
- **Why it matters**: Multivariate methods should shine on long gaps where per-column Fourier fails
- **Configurations**: Tests short (20), medium (40), long (60) blocks with various numbers of blocks

### 4. **Network Effect Isolation Tests**
- **Implementation**: Added `run_network_effect_isolation_tests()` method
- **What it does**: Isolates the network component with extended ablation studies
- **Why it matters**: Tests whether the multivariate network component actually contributes
- **Configurations**: Tests pure spectral, pure network, balanced, and various ablation configurations

### 5. **Cross-Feature Correlation Analysis**
- **Implementation**: Added `print_cross_feature_correlation()` method
- **What it does**: Prints detailed correlation analysis for all test data
- **Why it matters**: Verifies multivariate structure exists and provides context for results
- **Metrics**: Mean/max off-diagonal correlation with interpretive guidance

### 6. **Enhanced CLI Options**
New command-line options for targeted testing:
- `--multivariate-only`: Run only multivariate advantage tests
- `--network-only`: Run only network effect isolation tests  
- `--mar-mnar-only`: Run only MAR/MNAR stress tests
- `--block-only`: Run only block missing stress tests

### 7. **Enhanced Quick Mode**
- **Improvement**: Quick mode now includes correlation and multivariate tests
- **What it does**: Adds correlation to quick baseline data and runs multivariate advantage tests
- **Why it matters**: Even quick tests now demonstrate multivariate capabilities

## Key Insights from Test Results

### Multivariate Advantage Demonstrated
The tests now clearly show:
1. **MISSNET vs Fourier Identical Issue**: When no cross-feature correlation exists, MISSNET autotune often enables spectral mode, making it identical to per-column Fourier
2. **Correlation Impact**: Tests with high correlation (rho=0.8) show different performance patterns
3. **Missing Pattern Effects**: MAR/MNAR patterns show different behavior than MCAR
4. **Block Missing Challenges**: Long gaps create scenarios where multivariate methods should excel

### Cross-Feature Correlation Analysis
The correlation analysis shows:
- **High Correlation**: Mean |off-diagonal corr| > 0.5 indicates multivariate methods should excel
- **Low Correlation**: Mean |off-diagonal corr| < 0.1 suggests multivariate advantage may not be visible
- **Interpretive Guidance**: Automatic warnings/recommendations based on correlation levels

### Network Effect Isolation
Extended ablation studies reveal:
- **Pure Spectral**: `alpha=0.0` tests temporal-only component
- **Pure Network**: `alpha=1.0` tests multivariate-only component  
- **Balanced**: `alpha=0.5, beta=0.1` tests combined approach
- **Feature Toggles**: Individual testing of robust loss, skeleton, spectral components

## Usage Examples

### Run All Multivariate Tests
```bash
python3 test_missnet_synthetic.py --multivariate-only
```

### Run Network Effect Isolation
```bash
python3 test_missnet_synthetic.py --network-only
```

### Run MAR/MNAR Stress Tests
```bash
python3 test_missnet_synthetic.py --mar-mnar-only
```

### Run Block Missing Tests
```bash
python3 test_missnet_synthetic.py --block-only
```

### Enhanced Quick Mode
```bash
python3 test_missnet_synthetic.py --quick
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Block Missing Helper
```python
def introduce_block_missing(self, X, block_len=40, n_blocks=3, seed=0):
    """Creates long gaps in random columns"""
    # Randomly selects columns and start positions
    # Creates contiguous blocks of missing values
```

### Correlation Analysis
```python
def print_cross_feature_correlation(self, X, title="Data"):
    """Analyzes cross-feature correlation structure"""
    # Calculates mean/max off-diagonal correlations
    # Provides interpretive guidance
```

### Enhanced Baseline Testing
- All baseline methods now use identical masks for fair comparison
- Cross-feature correlation is printed for all test scenarios
- Results are stored with comprehensive metadata

## Addressing Your Original Questions

### "Why does my model score exactly the same as Fourier?"
**Answer**: The enhanced tests now demonstrate this occurs when:
1. No cross-feature correlation exists in the data
2. Autotuner enables spectral mode (use_spectral=True)
3. MISSNET reduces to per-column Fourier fit

### "How to test multivariate ability?"
**Answer**: The enhanced suite provides multiple approaches:
1. **Strong correlation tests** (rho=0.8) with MCAR/MAR/MNAR
2. **Block missing tests** where per-column methods fail
3. **Network isolation tests** to verify multivariate contribution
4. **Correlation analysis** to verify multivariate structure exists

## Future Enhancements

The enhanced test suite provides a solid foundation for:
1. Additional missing pattern variations
2. Different correlation structures (non-AR(1))
3. Real-world data validation
4. Performance benchmarking
5. Ablation study extensions

## Conclusion

The enhanced test suite successfully addresses all your requirements:
- ✅ Strong cross-feature correlation testing
- ✅ MAR/MNAR stress testing  
- ✅ Block missing pattern testing
- ✅ Network effect isolation
- ✅ Cross-feature correlation analysis
- ✅ CLI options for targeted testing

The suite now properly demonstrates when MISSNET should have multivariate advantage and provides clear diagnostic information to understand when and why these advantages occur.
